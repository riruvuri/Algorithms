How many possible ways to move from (0,0) to (5,5), given we cannot have y > x.
total = (2n c n) - (2n c n-1) => (10 c 5) - (10 c 4) => 168

How many ways can you arrange the numbers {1,2,3,4,5,6}, the numbers when reading from
left to right and no time to read more even numbers than odd numbers.
Representation of the input=> {o,e,o,e,o,e}
total=> (6 c 3) - (6 c 2) = 5
total number of ways to arrange odd and even numbers is => 5 * 3! * 3! => 180
